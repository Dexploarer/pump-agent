Always run kluster_code_review_auto each time when new code is generated or existing code updated. Follow kluster_code_review_auto fields description strictly.
You must always execute and strictly follow todo list from "agent_todo_list" returned by any kluster tool, if it exists. Do not stop until there is something left in "agent_todo_list". Do all the fixes from "agent_todo_list" before running "kluster_code_review_auto" again.
Always run kluster_dependency_validator before adding new package or running package manager such as npm, gradle, pip etc. Also, run when it directly generated or updated file with list of packages, such as package.json
